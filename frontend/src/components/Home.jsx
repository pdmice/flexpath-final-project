      <p>
        You can use this site to search for sings happening within a given
        distance and time when you're traveling. For example, if you're planning
        a trip to Philly in the first week of June you can search here to see if
        there are any sings you can get to easily, instead of flipping through
        minutes or scrolling through spreadsheets.
